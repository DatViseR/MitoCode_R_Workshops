# Introduction to R Markdown 

## What is R markdown?

From the [R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com):


>***"Analyze. Share. Reproduce.***
***Your data tells a story. Tell it with R Markdown. Turn your analyses into high quality documents, reports, presentations and dashboards."***


From the introduction of the [Definite guide to R markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/basics.html):

>***"R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both    save and execute code, and generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience. R Markdown was designed for easier reproducibility, since both the computing code and narratives are in the same document, and results are automatically generated from the source code. R Markdown supports dozens of static and dynamic/interactive output formats.If you prefer a video introduction to R Markdown, we recommend that you check out the website https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com, and watch the videos in the “Get Started” section, which cover the basics of R Markdown."***

## What can be created using R markdown?

With R Markdown, you write a single *.Rmd file and then use it to render finished output in a variety of formats:


* <strong>Static documents:
  + HTML
  + PDF
  + Word
  + blog
  + Scientific journal style templates available

* Interactive documents: 
  + Interactive shiny web apps 
  + Static interactive dashboards with embedded HTML widgets

* Presentations
* Books 
* Great R coding tutorials like this one:)
* and many other... </strong>

## Reproducible is the keyword here!

With R markdown you can easily create `reproducible analyses workflows`. You found an error in the data, new data was added, you need to process it in a slightly different way - you may just need to change one parameter in the input and `voilà`  or perform almost everything from scratch...I definitely prefer having a reproducible `*.Rmd` file for may analyses. 


# R markdow syntax basics {#h1 }

## Headers

Headers are created using `#` - the number of `#` correspond to the header, subheader(header 2),  subsubheader(header 3) etc.


`#### Header 4`

`##### Header 5`

`###### Header 6`

gives:

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

###### Header 6


etc. as you see only headers 1:3 are by default automatically included in the table of contents.

## Inline code formating and code evaluation within text paragraphs

You can `display code formatting` in the text parts of your document by surrounding it with  `
 
To evaluate r code inside the text block you need to use "r some code" for example to display current date with  `Sys.Date()`  you can write r Sys.Date() surrounded with ticks which gives `r Sys.Date()` for the day I have knitted this document .

```{r}
# evaluating r code inside text paragraphs
# the syntax is as follows `r some code` 

# to display r formating use `this will be formatted to code` 

```

## Adding code chunks
```{r}
# The code chunks are created by introducing 
#  ``` {r}
#  This would be a code chunk
#
#  ```` at the beginning of the lines 
```

## Adding links
The syntax for adding links is as follows:
```{r}
# [Link_name](path)
```
Lets ad link to [Bigest R repository - the CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)

## Adding images
The syntax for adding images is as follows:
```{r}
# ![caption](path)

```
Lets ad the image of the [famous grumpy cat](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumpy_Cat)
![grumpy cat](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/26AC/production/_107000990_grumpycat5.jpg) 

## Formating text

```{r}
# **bold** or __bold__
# `*italic* or _italic_
#` ***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___
#``~~strikethrough~~
```
gives:

**bold** or __bold__

*italic* or _italic_

***bold and italic*** or ___bold and italic___

~~strikethrough~~


# The NHANES dataset

`library(NHANES)` provides the data from the [US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). It may be considered as a random sample of the US population. We will use it as an example dataset during this workshop.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(NHANES)  # you may need to install it with install.packages()
library(dplyr)
# Lets  examine the structure of the NHANES dataset
glimpse(NHANES)
# first rows
head(NHANES)
```
